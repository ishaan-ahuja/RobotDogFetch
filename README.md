# RobotDogFetch
This project uses a custom YOLOv5 model to track and follow a 3d printed ball to help a dog play fetch using a live camera. The model is trained to find the ball in each video frame and track its movement as it runs to get the ball and comes back. By looking at where the ball is and how big it looks in the video, the system can tell how far the ball is from the dog.
